Discoverability

or - How NOT to not be seen
---------------------------

Some people try not to be seen. [This does not always end well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2hs3sXGo)
If your goals are the contrary, however, then these tips may be of value.

The best thing you can do, although perhaps the hardest, is to provide good
content that people will want to watch. No amount of discoverability will
help if viewers wander off bored. Of course, this is simple but not easy,
and this document isn't the place to discuss that, beyond empahsizing its
importance.

So how can you be found? Starting with the simplest and easiest methods...

* Stream category. While this may seem obvious, it's also quite important, and
  there are many people who browse categories for games they love, or browse
  the Art category, or whatever it is they want to watch. It's easy, free, and
  can definitely help!
* Title and tags. As these are free-form, they are less effective at showing
  your stream to viewers, but more effective at telling them whether they want
  to watch. Certain keywords might show up in searches, though, so check your
  analytics and see what helps.
* [Stream team](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-teams)! Partners can
  create them, everyone can join them [TODO: do you need to be affiliated?].
  A stream team can help you find friends, and can help viewers find you.
* Network. Yes, this is another really hard one, but immensely valuable. Again,
  this page is not the place to go into detail about this, but you can help
  your stream grow by raiding at the end of your streams, spending time in
  other people's streams, and generally making friends and establishing good
  connections.
* Followers. If someone's interested enough in your content to ask Twitch to
  tell them when you go live, they're likely to want to watch you. Just don't
  fall for the spammers who promise to sell you hollow follows.
* Viewers. While there are many points of confusion regarding [how viewership
  is counted](ViewCounts), it is generally accepted that more viewers - even
  ones that "aren't counted" - will help with your visibility. Which in turn
  means that every single person watching your stream is valuable!

The flip side of this is some things you can do that will turn people away.
It's a waste of time attracting someone to see your stream if you then push
them away from watching or chatting. This list is entirely subjective, and
what's a major turn-off for one person might be a complete non-issue for
another.

* Chat restrictions. Slow mode? Instant follower-only mode? Time-delayed
  follower-only mode? Unique chat? Subscriber-only? All of these will drive
  viewers away, to greater or lesser extents (slow mode is the least concern,
  sub-only will block people who don't pay money). Similarly, requiring that
  a user have two-factor authentication, or phone verification, or any other
  restriction, will immediately dissuade those who have not done so. These
  measures are effective at reducing spam, but they do so by also reducing
  legit chatters too.
* Lengthy chat rules. Keep 'em brief or nobody will want to read them.
* Unexplained lack of interactivity. There's nothing wrong with streaming
  without a webcam or microphone, but without some sort of connection between
  you and the viewers, there's less to keep them watching you. Fortunately,
  recent chat messages will be shown to newly-arriving chatters, which can
  help with this. (As a side note, this is another great reason to have some
  sort of countdown timer on your starting and BRB scenes. Someone who sees
  that it's only a couple of minutes until you return is more likely to stick
  around than someone who just sees that you're absent.)
* Obnoxious sounds or visuals. This is even more subjective than the others
  on this list, so all I will say is that, for every viewer, there is a limit
  to what they will want to accept.
* Toxic people in your chat. You have a banhammer for a reason; create the
  chat environment that your viewers will want to hang out in.
